            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web. HTTP/1.1, introduced in 1997, has been the workhorse of the web for over two decades. In 2015, HTTP/2 was standardized to address the limitations of HTTP/1.1 and to optimize the performance of web applications.</p>

        <section id="performance">
            <h2>Performance</h2>
            <p>HTTP/2 significantly improves performance over HTTP/1.1. Here are some key aspects:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>**Multiplexing**: Allows multiple requests and responses to be sent simultaneously over a single TCP connection, reducing latency and improving page load times.</li>
                <li>**Header Compression**: Reduces the overhead of HTTP headers using HPACK compression, which is particularly beneficial for repetitive header data in modern web applications.</li>
                <li>**Server Push**: Enables the server to send resources to the client before they are requested, potentially speeding up the loading of webpages.</li>
                <li>**Stream Prioritization**: Allows developers to prioritize critical resources, ensuring that the most important content is loaded first.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section id="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>HTTP/1.1 served the web well for many years, but HTTP/2 brings a host of enhancements that cater to the needs of modern web applications. The move to HTTP/2 offers significant performance benefits and improves the user experience by reducing page load times and enhancing resource management.</p>
